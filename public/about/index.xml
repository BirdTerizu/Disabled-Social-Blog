      <description>We deliberately chose the PaperMod theme for our blog because of its simplicity. In this post, I will cover the site organizational structure so that you understand how to navigate the site.
Categories We are using Categories as a primary menu item. e.g., guides, transparency reportst, living disabled, benefits, medical conditions, etc.
If you click the link at the top of the blog, you will be taken to the categories page which lists the different categories along with the number of posts in that category.</description>
