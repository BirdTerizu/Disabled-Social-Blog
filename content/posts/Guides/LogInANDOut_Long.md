NOTE: These instructions are specific to the app and web client you are using. But the general premise is the same.

## Account Log In

### Desktop/Laptop

**Step 1.** In a web browser, type [disabled.social](https://disabled.social). You will arrive at the landing page.

![The home screen of disabled.social which is broken up into three different vertical panels. On the left hand side is some general information about the instance. The middle panel is an example of a feed, hashtags, and news. The right panel has a sign in button and a create account button.](/img/Guides/Account_Sign_Up/DisabledSocialLandingPage.png)

**Step 2.** Once you’ve finished the steps in the account creation guide and you’ve been approved, then you can log in with your credentials. After you’ve logged in, you will see your home feed.

### Mobile with Mastodon App

![A compound image with three different panels, each corresponding to a different step. The panel on the left hand side is for Step 1. The mastodon home screen has two buttons you can click. The top one says get started and the one below it says log in. The middle panel is for Step 2. This screen is where you select the instance that you want to sign in to. There is a text box for you to type in the instance, and then you need to select the corresponding radio button. At the bottom is a back button on the left and a next button on the right. And the panel on the right hand side is for step 3. This screen goes over the required authorizations. The permissions include read and write access for everything, relationships, and push notifications. On the bottom left is the button to authorize and on the bottom right is the button to deny.](/img/Guides/LogInOut/MastodonAppLogin.png)

**Step 1.** After installing the Mastodon app on your device, open it up. You will see the screen above. Click the log in button.

**Step 2.** Type disabled.social into search. Select corresponding radio button. Click Next.

**Step 3.** If you are ok with the authorizations, click Authorize.

You will see your home feed once correctly logged in.

### Other Ways to Log In

Please note that there are other ways to log in, including various apps for iOS and Android. There are also different clients for laptops and desktops. A listing of these can be found [here in the apps section of the Mastodon website](https://joinmastodon.org/apps). Just select what system you are using, and it will show you the options. I really like Pinafore when using the Web on my laptop. It’s a very simple interface.

## Account Sign Out

### Desktop/Laptop

![A compound image with two different panels, each corresponding to a different step. The panel on the left corresponds to step 1. The home feed primary menu consists of: home, notifications, explore, local, federated, direct messages, favourites, bookmarks, lists, preferences, follows and followers. The panel on the right corresponds to step 2. The secondary menu pops up after clicking on preferences. It consists of: profile, preferences (which will default to expanded mode and includes appearance, notifications, and other), follows and followers, filters, automated post deletion, account, import and export, invite people, development, and logout. The logout is at the very bottom.](/img/Guides/LogInOut/DesktopLogOut.png)

It's in the 'spicy zone.'](/img/Guides/LogInOut/MastodonAppLogOut.png)
