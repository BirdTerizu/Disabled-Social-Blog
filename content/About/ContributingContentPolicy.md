The Disabled Social Blog is intended to be a general repository of information for living as a chronically ill and/or disabled person. As such, there will be contributions from many different people.

If you decide to contribute a post on the Disabled Social Blog, you retain full copyright of the material including the text, images, videos, etc. You can request any modifications up to and including deletion of the post at any point in time. To do this, please email us at: [mastmd@cmdoms.com](mailto://mastmd@cmdoms.com). If you are requesting deletion, we will first share a copy of the files with you if you want them for your records, delete the post in its entirety, and request that Google de-index the content so that it no longer appears in search. 

The reasoning behind this creator copyright policy is that we understand that sometimes things change (e.g., you are under review for disability benefits, are applying for a job, etc.), and you don't want certain pieces of information floating around on the web. 

If you wish to contribute content to the Disabled Social Blog, please contact us at the email address listed above and be sure to adhere to the submission guidelines below. You can choose to publish anonymously, under a pseudonym, under your real name, or whatever format you choose. If you are an established blogger, you are free to link to your blog. Regardless of whether or not you are a blogger, you are always free to link to your socials.

## Submission Guidelines

- Content must adhere to the guidelines and best practices outlined on our server at [disabled.social](https://disabled.social/about), including any age restrictions. Submitted content violating any of these policies will be requested to be revised or refused for publishing. 
- All submitted content must also adhere to accessibility best practices for online content, including alt texted images, video captions, no flashing lights in videos, etc.
