title: "How to Navigate this Site"

We deliberately chose the PaperMod theme for our blog because of its simplicity. In this post, I will cover the site organizational structure so that you understand how to navigate the site.

## Categories

We are using Categories as a primary menu item. e.g., guides, transparency reportst, living disabled, benefits, medical conditions, etc. 

If you click the link at the top of the blog, you will be taken to the categories page which lists the different categories along with the number of posts in that category.

## Tags

We are essentially using tags as a secondary menu item, since our theme does not support a secondary menu feature directly in the code. Tags will allow us to further refine a categorie. For example, for the posts in medical conditions, they might be tagged under long covid, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, endometriosis, etc. For benefits, you might see tags like SSI, SSDI, etc. And so on.

If you click on the link at the top of the blog, you will be taken to the tags page which lists the different tags along with the number of posts that contain that tag.

## Posts

The posts page is an overall listing of all of the posts contained on the Disabled Social Blog with the most recent appearing first.

## About

The about page is a collection of posts about the site, including: an About Us post that introduces the team so that you can learn a little more about them; a post that teaches you how to navigate the site; a post detailing the privacy policy; and a post that details the creator copyright policy.

## Contact Us

The contact us page contains the contact information for each administrator and moderator in case you need to get in touch with one of us.

## Archives

The Archives page lists all of the posts according to the month and the year that they were published in, with the most recent appearing first.

## Screen Contrast

In the upper left hand corner, to the right of the Disabled Social Blog title is a little moon. You can toggle that on or off to change the contrast from an off white background to a black background. 

## How to Share Content

At the bottom of every post are social media icons that allow you to share posts with others. 

## Post Structure

At the top of every post are breadcrumbs, which shows you where you are in the site's organizational structure at all times. The date in which the post was created and the average time to read through the post is also listed for informational purposes. There is also a table of contents at the top of every post to allow you to see a post's outline and to make it easier for you to quickly navigate to the section you are interested in. 

Additionally, in the lower right hand corner is a little up arrow that you can click on to bring you to the top of a post.
